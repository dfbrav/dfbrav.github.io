  <p>Introduction</p>
  <p>Hi there! My name is David Lankford-Bravo and I am currently a PhD student at the University of Texas at El Paso. My PhD thesis is focused on understanding the development of salt structures around the Onion Creek Salt Diapir in Fisher Valley, Utah. I use traditional field geology methods coupled with modern technology to make observations about geology that otherwise would be unattainable. I'm also focused on trying to bring datascience and machine learning to field geology. My github repository will host some of those efforts in python.</p>
  <p>I'm also really interested in communicating and teaching earth science in a way that makes our field more accessible to researchers and students. One way I do that is by building 3D photogrammetric models of outcrops using drones. I then integrate the field-collected data into the model to visualize the relationships we see. Below are models from field work I helped out with in Austrailia and from my own PhD research in Utah!</p>

  <p>About Me</p>
  <p>I live in Texas while I do my PhD and enjoy the food, culture and people. While most of my life right now is focused on my research and community projects, I also do indulge in a few hobbies. I love playing music, with experience in guitar and saxophone. I dabble in producing a little. Photography is one of my passions and I'll eventually put a portfolio up here. Writing, reading, and drawing are classic loves of mine and I like to integrate them with my photography as a I explore the concepts of good design. I'll finish off by mentioning my love of learning languages (English, Spanish, Russian), and my love for working on things. Give me a truck, a mechanical problem, or a christmas puzzle and I'm happy trying to figure out what is missing!  </p>
  <p>Drop a line if you'd like to collaborate on research, projects, or want to discuss any techniques or concepts. Looking forward to our next collaboration!</p>

  <p>Collaborations</p>
  <p>While I have worked on a variety of projects with some excellent people, this portion is to showcase my current collaborations. At the moment I am working with Sarah Giles on fluid flow adjacent to salt diapirs and how fluvial systems interact with the dynamic topography created by passive salt diapir movement. Her website is here:</p>
  <p>Our field sites are at the Onion Creek Salt Diapir, Utah, the Flinders Ranges, South Australia, and potentially in Death Valley, CA.</p>
</div>
<div class="SectionBottomR">
  <p>Student Projects</p>
  <p>Sarah and I supervise three undergraduates and have them working a variety of structural, sedimentological and geochemical studies to investigate fluid flow around salt diapirs. Their abstracts, pictures and a blurb on their research will be uploaded at some point on this website.</p>

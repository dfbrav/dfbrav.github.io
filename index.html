						<h2>Hi! Welcome to my website !</h2>
						<p>
					    My name is David Lankford-Bravo and I am a geoscientist passionate about integrating technology and field work to better understand our earth, its history, and its processes. Feel free to explore this website to learn more about my projects and collaborations!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

						    Creative,&nbsp; Curious, Driven, Collaborative and Dynamic</p>
						</header>
						<p>
					    I am a values-driven scientist, student, and leader focusing working to support the people, teams and systems around me. I believe that living a balanced life is critical to functioning at the highest level and actively strive to better balance an active lifestyle with one of study and research.&nbsp; Having grown up half-hispanic, access to education and cultural inclusion are very important to me as is supporting diversity of thought. Though I have many hobbies, biking, hiking, camping, photography and language learning are my most active ones and you'll see some of my favorite pictures from my travels in the photography tab. Click around this website and its various tabs to see some of the 3D models I've developed for my PhD research, learn more about my involvement with the World Petroleum Council, and explore the fun work I've done with collaborators and our mentees!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

								<p>
							    Through research focused on salt tectonics, plate tectonics, geophysical forward modelling and integrating data science and analytics with field geology I aim to contribute our every growing  energy and environmental science&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;body of knowledge. I'm fascinated with integrating technology with fied geology and actively work on developing new workflows to integrate the power of photogrammetry with the analysis of detailed geologic work. You can look at my <a href="Downloadable_Files/CV_Feb2020_DavidLankfordBravo.docx">CV</a> to see an up to date list of my work.</p>
